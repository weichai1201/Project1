Front end Web Project 1
Reflection
   Website is a collection of web pages, a website with all the pages constitutes a complete website, web design refers to the overall page design, including pattern, colour, content, pictures and so on. The first step of web design is to design the layout. In the fourth or fifth week of school, we typesetter the web page with paper and pen, and learned many excellent websites. Just like newspaper typesetting, we divided the page into sections and slowly added the information needed to each section. I think the colour collocation of pictures plays a very important role, different picture colours give people different psychological hints, can affect our mood. And the picture colour collocation can give people a sense of space, hierarchy, intimacy. So, I used a lighter image in index.html to accentuate the space of the colours. I used black and white text to make the whole homepage soft and light.
   
Advantage
    At the beginning of this website, I used a lot of techniques, such as CSS Background Image, CSS styling images and so on. In addition, I used bootstrap that I was good at learning. (But it doesn't apply here) My home page is full of images that really show what the holidays are about. I use CSS Media Query for different device resolutions to solve multiple device display adaptation problems. I use JavaScript to enrich the content of web pages and improve the ease of use of web pages.
    
Disadvantage
Unfortunately, it was stated in the assignment requirements that bootstrap could not be used, so I encountered many obstacles and kept trying other methods to solve them. Also, I get white gap between navbar and header, Extra white gap between images, images do not fill the whole web page, white space between footer and content, CSS learning content needs to be constantly improved. I don't have pictures on other pages. Just plain words. Maybe a hero banner on each would work. I need more research and reference websites to learn more about the title style of websites and whether text shadow is suitable for designing on the title. I need consistent spacing on other pages. Not all sites have full-width text and need to refer to design materials and sites and how they lay out content pages. Don't need to link to Google, YouTube, etc in the footer, also do not need for email. On the mobile views (less than 425px) the navigation is too small to read and the spacing between elements is inconsistent. The responsive view needs to be refined. I should learn more about the rules of responsive web layout.
